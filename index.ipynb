    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "1. INTEGER, 2. TEXT, 3. BLOB, 4. REAL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys are the unique key on the selected table. The foreign key is a key in the table that is used as a primary key in its home table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- One-to-many: Means the table with the primary key holds the foreign key for the other table. This makes it possible for the primary table to contain multiple foreign keys for other tables. e.g. one customer having multiple orders\n",
    "- Many-to-many: Relationship where a table can hold many keys for other tables, and those tables can in turn have several keys linking back to the primary table. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "1. Inner join: The most common. Joins together two tables, using the specified index, and the new table contains all the rows that have matching index. \n",
    "2. Left Join: The new table will have all the data in left table as well as any data that has matching keys in the right table. \n",
    "3. Right Join: Opposite of Left join.\n",
    "4. Outer Join: Creates new table with all rows from both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functionst are used by GROUP BY statements to create new values such as SUM(value) AS newValue.\n",
    "They can be used to count the number of index's in a employee table grouped by team, and that will give you a new value that can represent the total employees in each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Joining many-to-many relationships will result in a very very large dataset. It will create a row for each combination represented, which means the table will become redundant and unwieldy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
